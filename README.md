# Credit-Fraud-Prediction
The purpose of this study is to build a model that can effectively detect fraudulent transactions and help financial institutions protect their customers from potential losses due to fraudulent activity, as well as a credit card fraud detection model that works effectively with "unseen" or "out-of-distribution" data. Unseen data is data that differs dramatically from training data, replicating real-world events in which the model meets transactions it has never seen before.
Financial Institutions (Banks) are continuously dealing with fraud activities, and this increasing over time because of the multiple options that customers have nowadays to process payments, and the same time it's getting more difficult to prevent fraudulent activities, because of the various methods possible for scammers to access to private information. this is the main reason of this study, to be able to create a model in order to predict real-world and real-time fraud transactions.
